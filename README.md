# PHOTON font Fira
## FONT plugin

This plugin adds the Fira font collection resources to a PHOTON archive. 

## Configuration

Before configuring this plugin, you should copy the `user/plugins/font-fira/font-fira.yaml` to `user/config/plugins/font-fira.yaml` and only edit that copy.

Here is the default configuration and an explanation of available options:

```yaml
enabled: true
```

Note that if you use the admin plugin, a file with your configuration, and named font-fira.yaml will be saved in the `user/config/plugins/` folder once the configuration is saved in the admin.
